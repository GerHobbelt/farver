```

The goal of farver is to provide very fast, vectorised functions for 
conversion of colours between different colour spaces, colour comparisons 
(distance between colours), encoding/decoding, and channel manipulation in 
colour strings. To this end it provides an interface to a modified 
version of the [ColorSpace](https://github.com/berendeanicolae/ColorSpace) C++ 
library developed by Berendea Nicolae.

## Installation
farver can be installed from CRAN using `install.packages('farver')`. The 
development version can be installed from Github using `devtools`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github('thomasp85/farver')
```

## Use
farver provides an alternative to the `grDevices::rgb()` and 
`grDevices::col2rgb()` for encoding and decoding colours strings. The farver 
functions are superficially equivalent but provides a uniform output format, and
the option to encode and decode directly from/to other colour spaces.

```{r}
library(farver)

codes <- rainbow(10)
codes

spectrum <- decode_colour(codes)
spectrum

encode_colour(spectrum)
```

It also provides an alternative to `grDevices::convertColor()` to switch between
colours spaces. If the origin is a colour string it is possible to decode 
directly into the given colour space. Conversely, if the endpoint is a colour
string it is also possible to encode directly from a given colour space.

```{r}
spectrum_lab <- convert_colour(spectrum, 'rgb', 'lab')
spectrum_lab

decode_colour(codes, to = 'lab')

encode_colour(spectrum_lab, from = 'lab')
```

If colours are given as strings, manipulation of channels will normally require
decoding, conversion to the correct colour space, manipulation of the given 
channel, converting back to rgb and the encoding to string. farver provides a
range of functions that allow you to change any channel in the supported spaces
directly in colour strings:

```{r}
# Add a value to the channel
add_to_channel(codes, channel = 'l', value = 1:10, space = 'lab')

# Set a channel to a specific value
set_channel(codes, 'alpha', c(0.3, 0.7))

# Limit a channel to a given value
cap_channel(codes, 'r', 200)
```

Lastly, farver also provides utilities for calculating the distance between
colours, based on a range of different measures

```{r}
spectrum2 <- t(col2rgb(heat.colors(10)))

compare_colour(spectrum, spectrum2, 'rgb', method = 'cie2000')[1:6, 1:6]
```

## Supported colour spaces
`farver` currently supports the following colour spaces:

- CMY
- CMYK
- HSL
- HSB
- HSV
- CIE L*AB
- Hunter LAB
- LCH(ab)
- LCH(uv)
- LUV
- RGB
- XYZ
- YXY

## Supported distance measures
`farver` supports the following colour distance metrics

- Euclidean
- CIE1976
- CIE94
- CIE2000
- CMC

## White References
`farver` allows you to set the white point for relative colour spaces, either
based on a standard illuminant (A-F series supported) or by specifying 
chromaticity coordinates or tristimulus values directly

## Benchmark
`farver` is faster than its `grDevices` counterpart but less so than it was at 
its first release, as the colour conversion in grDevices has been improved 
since.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
test <- matrix(runif(300000, min = 0, max = 255), ncol = 3)
timing <- bench::mark(
  farver = convert_colour(test, 'rgb', 'lab'),
  grDevices = convertColor(test, 'sRGB', 'Lab', scale.in = 255), 
  check = FALSE,
  min_iterations = 100
)
plot(timing, type = 'ridge')
```

Still, if the start- and/or endpoint are colour strings the ability
to decode and encode directly from/to any colour space will give a huge speed 
up.

```{r, message=FALSE}
colour_strings <- colours()
timing <- bench::mark(
  farver = decode_colour(colour_strings, to = 'lab'),
  grDevices = convertColor(t(col2rgb(colour_strings)), 'sRGB', 'Lab', scale.in = 255), 
  check = FALSE,
  min_iterations = 100
)
plot(timing, type = 'ridge')
```
