- title: Colour space conversion
  desc: >
    This is the raison d'Ãªtre of the package. Take a matrix or data frame with
    colour channels in the columns, and convert it from one colour space to 
    another. Channels are automatically capped if they have defined bounds, and
    any `NaN`, `NA`, `Inf`, or `-Inf` values in the input will result in a row
    of `NA` values in the output.

- title: Colour comparison
  desc: >
    Getting a numeric value describing the distance between two colours is not a
    trivial task, and several metrics have been devised for that. farver 
    supports a range of these, and allows you to compare colours in any space
    with each others.
  contents:
  - compare_colour
- title: Converting to and from colour strings
  desc: >
    The native format of colours in R (and other languages) is often hexadecimal
    encoded rgb values (`#RRGGBB`). farver provides utilities for easily going
    back and forth between this and any colour space.
  contents:
  - encode_colour
  - decode_colour
- title: Colour string manipulation
  desc: >
    As colours are often encoded as strings, manipulation of individual channels
    requires decoding. and then encoding. farver does away with that by 
    providing a range of functions for directly manipulating channels in colour
    strings.
  contents:
  - set_channel
- title: Converting to and from native colour representation
  desc: >
    Under the hood, R encodes colours as integers, with the 32 bit in the 
    integer divided beetween red, green, blue, and alpha, giving them 8 bit (or
    256 values) each. farver provides a simple and fast way of converting 
    between the native integer representation and the string representation.
